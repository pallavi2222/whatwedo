The benefits to society will be greater in economies where entrepreneurs can operate flexibly, develop their ideas, and reap the rewards. Entrepreneurs are also more likely to become mentors or investors,giving rise to future generations of entrepreneurs.They are initiating a new era of trickle-up economics, in which high-impact entrepreneurs drive societal change, pushing big business and government to be more innovative, responsive, and inclusive, to the benefit of people formerly on the margins of society.<br/><br/> Partnerships between public and private are about to solve some common challenges which align with core business interests with development goals. It creates jobs, stimulates growth, and fights poverty and the main interest will be in the sourcing of goods or the use of local resources for their own production.Development partnerships are those in which opportunities to overcome key development challenges overlap with a companyâ€™s business challenges.<br/><br/>An inclusive approach is to create a positive social impact by avoiding negatively affecting stakeholders through their business activities and so links to environmental sustainability.</Content1></Content>
